# Responsive Navbar

## Overview

A persistent, top-of-viewport navigation bar that anchors the site identity on the left and presents navigation destinations on the right, adapting its layout across viewport sizes. Without a consistent navigation element, visitors must rely on back buttons or memorized URLs to move between pages — increasing friction and reducing discoverability of key sections.

## Users & Use Cases

**Primary users:** All site visitors navigating between pages.

**Key use cases:**

1. A first-time visitor lands on any page and uses the navbar to discover and navigate to other sections of the site without scrolling back to the top or returning to the home page.
2. A visitor on a mobile device taps the hamburger menu to access the full set of navigation destinations that would otherwise not fit in the narrow viewport.
3. A visitor on any page clicks the site identity (icon/name) in the navbar to return to the home page as a familiar orientation point.
4. A visitor scrolls down a long page and uses the pinned navbar to navigate elsewhere without scrolling back to the top.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Site identity element (icon and/or name) pinned to the left side of the navbar, functioning as a home link
- Horizontal navigation links displayed on the right side at wider viewports
- Hamburger menu trigger that replaces the horizontal links at narrow viewports, revealing a flat list of all navigation destinations
- Sticky positioning so the navbar remains visible during scrolling
- Responsive transition between expanded links and collapsed hamburger menu

**Out of scope:**

- Context-aware action slots (edit/view toggles, page-specific controls) — handled by individual page features
- Nested or multi-level dropdown menus within the hamburger
- Search bar or search functionality within the navbar
- User account controls, login/logout, or authentication-related UI
- Notification badges or indicators
- Breadcrumb navigation

**Deferred ideas:**

- Animated transitions for hamburger menu open/close
- Active state highlighting for the current page's link
- Dropdown sub-menus for grouped navigation at desktop widths
- Secondary navbar or sub-navigation bar below the primary navbar

## Capabilities

- [x] **P0**: Site identity element is displayed on the left side of the navbar and links to the home page
  - An icon, name, or combination of both is visible on the left edge of the navbar at all viewport sizes
  - Clicking or tapping the identity element navigates to the home page
  - The identity element has an accessible label describing its purpose as a home link

- [x] **P0**: Navigation destinations are displayed as horizontal links on the right side at wide viewports
  - All defined navigation destinations are visible as individual, clickable links
  - Links are displayed in a consistent, stable order
  - Each link navigates to the correct destination page

- [x] **P0**: Navigation destinations collapse into a hamburger menu at narrow viewports
  - A recognizable hamburger icon (three horizontal lines or equivalent) replaces the horizontal links below a defined breakpoint
  - Tapping the hamburger icon reveals a flat list of all navigation destinations
  - Tapping a destination in the list navigates to that page
  - Tapping the hamburger icon again or navigating away closes the menu

- [x] **P0**: Navbar remains pinned to the top of the viewport during scrolling
  - The navbar stays visible at the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the page
  - Page content scrolls beneath the navbar without overlapping or obscuring it
  - The navbar does not cause content at the top of the page to be hidden behind it on initial load

- [x] **P0**: Navbar is fully responsive across common device sizes
  - Layout adapts cleanly to desktop (1024px+), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px) viewports
  - The site identity element remains visible and legible at all sizes
  - No horizontal scrolling is introduced by the navbar at any viewport width

- [x] **P1**: Hamburger menu is accessible to keyboard and screen reader users
  - The hamburger trigger is keyboard-focusable and activatable via Enter or Space
  - The expanded menu can be navigated with keyboard (Tab, Escape to close)
  - The trigger has an accessible label (e.g., "Navigation menu") that communicates its purpose
  - Screen readers announce the expanded/collapsed state of the menu

- [x] **P2**: Navigation destination order remains stable across viewport transitions
  - The sequence of links in the expanded horizontal layout matches the sequence in the hamburger menu
  - Resizing the viewport does not reorder or drop navigation destinations

## Dependencies

- **Home Page** ([home-page.md](home-page.md)): The site identity element links to the home page; the home page must exist as a navigation destination.

## Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**

- The site has a defined identity (icon, name, or both) available for use in the navbar.
- Navigation destinations are statically defined and change infrequently; developer-managed updates are acceptable.
- The number of navigation destinations is small enough (3-6 items) that a flat list in the hamburger menu is sufficient without grouping or nesting.

**Key risks:**

- **Content overflow at medium viewports:** If the number of navigation links grows, the horizontal layout may overflow before reaching the narrow-viewport breakpoint. Mitigation: define the responsive breakpoint based on content width rather than a fixed pixel value, or set a maximum number of supported links in the horizontal layout.
- **Sticky positioning conflicts:** The pinned navbar may conflict with other fixed or sticky elements on the page (e.g., cookie banners, chat widgets). Mitigation: establish a clear stacking order convention so the navbar's layer priority is predictable.

## Success Metrics

1. Visitors can navigate to any primary page from any other page using the navbar without scrolling to the top of the page.
2. The navbar renders correctly with site identity visible and links accessible across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
3. On narrow viewports, the hamburger menu reveals all navigation destinations and each link functions correctly.
4. The navbar remains visible and functional during page scroll on all supported viewport sizes.

## Implementation Context

> This feature PRD is portable and project-agnostic. During implementation, consult the project's `gspec/profile.md` (target users, positioning), `gspec/style.md` (design system), `gspec/stack.md` (technology choices), and `gspec/practices.md` (development standards) to resolve project-specific context.
