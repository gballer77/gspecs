# Home Page

## Overview

A home page for a professional services business that introduces the brand, communicates its value proposition, and presents its service offerings. The page serves as the primary entry point for prospective clients researching the business, giving them enough information to understand what the firm does and why it is credible.

## Users & Use Cases

**Primary users:** Prospective clients visiting the website for the first time.

**Key use cases:**

1. A prospective client arrives from a search engine and needs to quickly understand what the business does and whether it is relevant to their needs.
2. A referral visits the site to validate the recommendation they received, looking for professionalism and evidence of expertise.
3. A returning visitor navigates back to the home page to review service offerings before engaging further.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Hero banner section with headline, supporting text, and optional imagery
- Value proposition section summarizing the firm's core differentiators
- Services overview section listing the primary service offerings with brief descriptions
- Responsive layout that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Static content coded directly into the page

**Out of scope:**

- Calls-to-action, buttons, or conversion flows (handled by a separate feature)
- Blog, news, or dynamic content feeds
- Client portal or authenticated experiences
- Search engine optimization tooling or analytics integration

**Deferred ideas:**

- Testimonials or social proof section
- Team or leadership section
- Partner or client logo bar
- Animation or scroll-based interactions

## Capabilities

- [ ] **P0**: Hero banner displays a prominent headline and supporting text that communicates what the business does
  - Headline and supporting text are visible immediately on page load without scrolling
  - Text is legible across viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  - Section accommodates an optional background image or visual element

- [ ] **P0**: Value proposition section presents 2-4 core differentiators of the business
  - Each differentiator has a short title and brief description
  - Differentiators are visually distinct and scannable (not a wall of text)
  - Section is visually separated from the hero and services sections

- [ ] **P0**: Services overview section lists the primary service offerings
  - Each service has a name and a brief description (1-3 sentences)
  - Services are presented in a consistent, repeatable layout pattern
  - The section accommodates 3-6 service items without feeling cluttered

  - Layout adapts cleanly to desktop (1024px+), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px) viewports
  - No horizontal scrolling on any viewport
  - Text remains readable and images scale appropriately at all sizes

  - Page is usable within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection
  - Images are appropriately sized and optimized for web delivery

- [ ] **P2**: Semantic page structure supports accessibility
  - Page uses proper heading hierarchy (single h1, logical h2/h3 nesting)
  - Images include descriptive alt text
  - Content is navigable via keyboard

## Dependencies

None. This is a foundational page with no dependencies on other features.

## Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**

- The business has established branding (name, logo, colors) available for use.
- Service offerings are defined and can be summarized in 1-3 sentences each.
- Static content is acceptable for the initial version; content updates will be infrequent and handled by developers.

**Key risks:**

- **Content readiness:** The page cannot launch without finalized copy for the hero, value proposition, and services sections. Mitigation: use realistic placeholder content during development so layout and structure can be validated independently.
- **Scope creep into conversion flows:** Without clear CTAs, stakeholders may push to add contact forms or booking widgets to this feature. Mitigation: CTA functionality is explicitly scoped to a separate feature.

## Success Metrics

1. Visitors can identify the business name, what it does, and its core services within 10 seconds of landing on the page.
2. The page renders correctly and is fully usable across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
3. Page load time is under 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
4. All content sections (hero, value proposition, services) are present and display without layout issues.

## Implementation Context

> This feature PRD is portable and project-agnostic. During implementation, consult the project's `gspec/profile.md` (target users, positioning), `gspec/style.md` (design system), `gspec/stack.md` (technology choices), and `gspec/practices.md` (development standards) to resolve project-specific context.
