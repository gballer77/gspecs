# Contact Page

## Overview

A static Contact page that displays the business's contact information so visitors can easily find how to get in touch. Without a clear, dedicated contact page, prospective clients may leave the site rather than search for scattered contact details — making this a critical conversion-support page.

## Users & Use Cases

**Primary users:** Prospective clients ready to reach out to the business.

**Key use cases:**

1. A prospective client has reviewed the services and about page and is now ready to make contact — they navigate to the Contact page to find an email address or phone number.
2. A visitor needs the business's physical address to visit in person or send correspondence.
3. A returning client needs to quickly look up the business's phone number or email without digging through old communications.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Display of core contact details: email address, phone number, and physical address
- Clear, scannable layout that makes each contact method immediately visible
- Responsive layout that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Static content coded directly into the page

**Out of scope:**

- Contact form or message submission functionality (separate feature)
- Embedded map or location visualization
- Live chat, chatbot, or real-time messaging
- Social media links or feeds
- Business hours display
- CMS-managed or dynamically loaded content

**Deferred ideas:**

- Embedded interactive map showing the business location
- Business hours section
- Social media profile links
- Multiple office or branch locations

## Capabilities

- [ ] **P0**: Page displays the business email address
  - Email address is visible without scrolling on desktop viewports
  - Email is rendered as a clickable `mailto:` link that opens the visitor's default email client
  - Email address is displayed as readable text (not hidden behind an icon or "Email Us" label alone)

- [ ] **P0**: Page displays the business phone number
  - Phone number is visible and formatted for readability
  - Phone number is rendered as a clickable `tel:` link that initiates a call on mobile devices
  - Phone number is displayed as readable text

- [ ] **P0**: Page displays the business physical address
  - Full mailing address is displayed in a standard, readable format
  - Address is presented as plain text (not solely as an image)

- [ ] **P0**: Page is fully responsive across common device sizes
  - Layout adapts cleanly to desktop (1024px+), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px) viewports
  - No horizontal scrolling on any viewport
  - Contact details remain legible and tappable at all sizes

- [ ] **P1**: Contact details are scannable and visually organized
  - Each contact method (email, phone, address) is visually distinct and separated
  - A visitor can identify all available contact methods within 5 seconds of viewing the page
  - Clear labels or headings distinguish each contact method

- [ ] **P2**: Semantic page structure supports accessibility
  - Page uses proper heading hierarchy (single h1, logical h2/h3 nesting)
  - Interactive elements (links) are keyboard-navigable and have accessible labels
  - Sufficient color contrast for all text elements

## Dependencies

- **Home Page** ([home-page.md](home-page.md)): The Contact page is a secondary page that visitors typically navigate to from the home page. Navigation between pages should be consistent.

## Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**

- The business has a single set of contact details (one email, one phone number, one address) to display.
- Contact information is stable and changes infrequently; developer-managed updates are acceptable.
- Static content is acceptable for the initial version.

**Key risks:**

- **Content readiness:** The page requires finalized contact details before launch. Mitigation: use realistic placeholder content during development so layout and structure can be validated independently.
- **Spam exposure:** Displaying email addresses and phone numbers as plain text exposes them to automated scraping. Mitigation: accept this tradeoff for usability in the initial version; obfuscation techniques can be added later if spam becomes a problem.

## Success Metrics

1. Visitors can identify at least one contact method (email, phone, or address) within 5 seconds of viewing the page.
2. The page renders correctly and is fully usable across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
3. All clickable contact methods (`mailto:` and `tel:` links) function correctly on their respective devices.

## Implementation Context

> This feature PRD is portable and project-agnostic. During implementation, consult the project's `gspec/profile.md` (target users, positioning), `gspec/style.md` (design system), `gspec/stack.md` (technology choices), and `gspec/practices.md` (development standards) to resolve project-specific context.
