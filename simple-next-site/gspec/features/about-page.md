# About Page

## Overview

A static About page that tells the story of the business and communicates its mission. The page gives visitors a sense of who is behind the brand, why the business exists, and what it stands for — building trust and credibility beyond the service offerings presented on the home page.

## Users & Use Cases

**Primary users:** Prospective clients evaluating the business before making contact.

**Key use cases:**

1. A prospective client wants to understand the people and values behind the business before deciding to engage, so they visit the About page to assess credibility and alignment.
2. A referral wants to learn more about the company's background and story to confirm the recommendation they received.
3. A visitor who has reviewed the services offered navigates to the About page to understand the mission and philosophy that drives those services.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Company story section explaining the background and origin of the business
- Mission or purpose statement section articulating why the business exists and what it stands for
- Responsive layout that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Static content coded directly into the page

**Out of scope:**

- Team member bios, headshots, or leadership profiles
- Calls-to-action, contact forms, or conversion elements
- Company timeline or milestones visualization
- Client testimonials or social proof
- Dynamic or CMS-managed content

**Deferred ideas:**

- Team or leadership section with bios and photos
- Company values displayed as distinct visual cards or icons
- Historical timeline or key milestones section
- Awards, certifications, or accreditations display

## Capabilities

- [ ] **P0**: Company story section communicates the background and origin of the business
  - Section includes a heading and one or more paragraphs of narrative text
  - Content is readable and well-structured without feeling like a wall of text
  - Section is visually distinct from the mission section

- [ ] **P0**: Mission or purpose statement section articulates why the business exists
  - Mission statement is presented with visual emphasis (e.g., larger text, distinct styling) to differentiate it from the narrative story
  - Statement is concise and scannable — ideally 1-3 sentences
  - Section is visually separated from the company story section

- [ ] **P0**: Page is fully responsive across common device sizes
  - Layout adapts cleanly to desktop (1024px+), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px) viewports

  - Text remains readable at all sizes

- [ ] **P1**: Page structure supports scannability
  - Clear visual hierarchy guides the visitor through the content in a logical order
  - Sections are separated with adequate spacing to avoid a dense, text-heavy appearance
  - Page can be skimmed in under 15 seconds to get the gist of the business

- [ ] **P2**: Semantic page structure supports accessibility
  - Page uses proper heading hierarchy (single h1, logical h2/h3 nesting)
  - Content is navigable via keyboard
  - Sufficient color contrast for all text elements

## Dependencies

- **Home Page** ([home-page.md](home-page.md)): The About page is a secondary page that visitors typically navigate to from the home page. Navigation between pages should be consistent.

## Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**

- The business has a defined story or background narrative that can be summarized for the page.
- A mission or purpose statement exists or can be drafted prior to implementation.
- Static content is acceptable; content updates will be infrequent and handled by developers.

**Key risks:**

- **Content readiness:** The page depends on finalized copy for the company story and mission statement. Mitigation: use realistic placeholder content during development so layout and structure can be validated independently.
- **Text-heavy appearance:** An About page with only narrative content can feel dense and uninviting. Mitigation: ensure the design uses adequate spacing, visual hierarchy, and section separation to maintain readability.

## Success Metrics

1. Visitors can identify the company's story and mission within 15 seconds of viewing the page.
2. The page renders correctly and is fully usable across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.
3. Content is structured into clearly distinct sections (story and mission) with visible separation.

## Implementation Context

> This feature PRD is portable and project-agnostic. During implementation, consult the project's `gspec/profile.md` (target users, positioning), `gspec/style.md` (design system), `gspec/stack.md` (technology choices), and `gspec/practices.md` (development standards) to resolve project-specific context.
