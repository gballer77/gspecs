# Theme Switcher

## Overview

A light/dark theme switcher that allows visitors to toggle between light and dark color schemes across all pages of the site. Many users prefer dark interfaces for comfort, reduced eye strain, or personal taste — and increasingly expect websites to respect their system-level preference. Without theme support, the site forces a single visual mode on all visitors regardless of context or preference.

## Users & Use Cases

**Primary users:** All site visitors.

**Key use cases:**

1. A visitor browsing at night prefers a dark interface to reduce eye strain and toggles to dark mode using the switcher in the header.
2. A visitor whose operating system is set to dark mode arrives at the site and sees it automatically rendered in dark mode without needing to take any action.
3. A visitor who previously selected light mode returns to the site days later and finds their preference preserved — the site loads in light mode without requiring them to toggle again.
4. A visitor who normally uses OS-level dark mode wants the site specifically in light mode, so they override the default using the toggle — and the override sticks on future visits.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Toggle between a light theme and a dark theme
- Detection of the visitor's operating system color scheme preference
- User override of the OS default via manual toggle
- Persistence of the user's theme preference across browser sessions using client-side storage
- A toggle control placed in the site header/navigation bar, visible on all pages
- Theming applied consistently across all existing pages (home, about, contact)
- Smooth visual transition when switching themes (no jarring flash)

**Out of scope:**

- Multiple color themes beyond light and dark
- Custom user-defined themes or color pickers
- Server-side or account-based theme preference storage
- Theming of third-party embedded content (maps, widgets, iframes)
- High-contrast or accessibility-specific themes (separate feature)

**Deferred ideas:**

- Additional predefined color themes (e.g., sepia, high-contrast)
- Scheduled auto-switching based on time of day
- Per-page theme overrides
- Animated theme transition effects beyond a simple crossfade

## Capabilities

- [x] **P0**: Visitor can toggle between light and dark themes using a control in the site header
  - A toggle or icon button is visible in the header/navigation bar on all pages
  - Clicking the toggle switches the entire page between light and dark color schemes
  - The current theme state is visually indicated by the toggle (e.g., sun icon for light, moon icon for dark)
  - The toggle is reachable and operable via keyboard

- [x] **P0**: Theme is applied consistently across all pages and components
  - All text, backgrounds, borders, and interactive elements reflect the active theme
  - No unstyled or mismatched elements remain when switching themes
  - Theme applies to the home page, about page, and contact page without page-specific overrides

- [x] **P0**: Site detects and respects the visitor's operating system color scheme preference on first visit
  - If the OS is set to dark mode, the site renders in dark mode on the first visit (before any manual toggle)
  - If the OS is set to light mode or has no preference, the site renders in light mode
  - Detection happens before the initial page paint to avoid a flash of the wrong theme

- [x] **P0**: Visitor's manual theme preference is persisted in client-side storage
  - After toggling, the selected theme is saved and survives browser tab closure and reopening
  - On subsequent visits, the persisted preference takes priority over the OS preference
  - If no persisted preference exists, the OS preference is used as the default

- [x] **P1**: Theme switch occurs without a flash of unstyled or incorrect-theme content
  - On page load, the correct theme is applied before the page becomes visible to the visitor
  - Toggling themes mid-session produces a smooth transition without a jarring flicker
  - Navigation between pages does not cause a momentary flash of the wrong theme

- [x] **P1**: Toggle control is responsive and works across all device sizes
  - Toggle is visible and tappable on mobile viewports without being obscured by other header elements
  - Toggle does not break header layout on any supported viewport size (desktop, tablet, mobile)

- [x] **P2**: Theme preference is accessible
  - Toggle has an accessible label describing its function (e.g., "Switch to dark mode" / "Switch to light mode")
  - Theme colors maintain sufficient contrast ratios for text readability in both light and dark modes
  - Toggle state change is announced to screen readers

## Dependencies

- **Home Page** ([home-page.md](home-page.md)): Theme must apply to all home page sections (hero, value proposition, services).
- **About Page** ([about-page.md](about-page.md)): Theme must apply to all about page content.
- **Contact Page** ([contact-page.md](contact-page.md)): Theme must apply to all contact page content.

The theme switcher depends on a shared site header/navigation existing across pages. If no shared header exists yet, one must be established for the toggle to have a consistent location.

## Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**

- The site uses a design approach where colors are defined as variables or tokens, making it feasible to swap between two palettes.
- A shared header or navigation component exists (or will be created) across all pages.
- Client-side storage is available in the visitor's browser (virtually universal in modern browsers).

**Open questions:**

- Exact contrast ratios and color values for the dark theme will need validation during implementation against accessibility standards.

**Key risks:**

- **Flash of incorrect theme on load:** If the theme preference is read too late in the page load process, visitors may see a brief flash of the wrong theme. Mitigation: apply the theme preference as early as possible in the page rendering pipeline, before the main content is painted.
- **Inconsistent theming across pages:** If pages are styled independently, some elements may not respond to the theme toggle. Mitigation: define theme colors as shared design tokens or variables referenced by all page styles.
- **Dark theme readability:** Poorly chosen dark theme colors can reduce readability or make the site feel amateurish. Mitigation: follow established dark theme design conventions (muted backgrounds, appropriate contrast, desaturated accent colors).

## Success Metrics

1. Visitors can switch between light and dark themes with a single click/tap and see the change applied immediately across the entire page.
2. The site loads in the visitor's preferred theme (OS-detected or previously saved) without a visible flash of the wrong theme.
3. A visitor's manually selected theme preference persists across at least 3 return visits over multiple days.
4. Both light and dark themes meet WCAG AA contrast requirements for all body text.

## Implementation Context

> This feature PRD is portable and project-agnostic. During implementation, consult the project's `gspec/profile.md` (target users, positioning), `gspec/style.md` (design system), `gspec/stack.md` (technology choices), and `gspec/practices.md` (development standards) to resolve project-specific context.
